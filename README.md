SburbSim Narrative is a SBURBSimulator mod that plans on adding narrative stuff like pacing, characterization and subtext that the original dunked in favor of quirks and rap battles. It'll also add some classpects and tweak mechanics.

***This mod is based on PoshPotato's mod, which is in on itself based on the original by jadedResearcher. You can find both, respectively, at https://poshpotato.github.io/SBURBSimulator/main/index2.html and https://farragofiction.com/SBURBSim/index2.html. Pleas give them credit.***
